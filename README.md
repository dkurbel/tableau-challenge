# tableau-challenge

## Introduction

### The goal of this project is to use Tableau to find and demonstrate 2 unexpected phenomena using 2 or more visualizations to demonstrate each phenomenon.

### Find my visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_16807293713400/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## Data Sources

### The data source used was "Citi Bike System Data" for New York City (https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). More info can be found at https://citibikenyc.com/system-data. The datasets used were from 2021-03 to 2023-02, filtered by "Casual" users and "Classic Bike" ride style.

## Dashboard Design

### The dashboard utilizes two coordinated pairs of graphs. The top and bottom graphs share color variation. The upper graphs represent higher total rides with a richer hue. The lower graphs represent seasons by distinct colors. By selecting on any point(s) within the visualizations, the entire dashboard will filter by the selection.

## Unexpected Phenomena

### 1) Central Park S & 6th Avenue (the top performing Start Station) saw its highest number of Casual Classic Bike users (600) in September at 3pm, later in the year and earlier in the day than the average peak usage across all Start Stations. It doesn't have the highest peak hour of all Start Stations, but the highest total users overall.

### 2) The next highest performing Start Stations are at West Street & Chambers Street, and 10th Avenue & W 14th Street. These are bustling areas with trendy restaurants, popular nightlife and tourist attractions that tend to draw their average users later in the day/night. West & Chambers sets the benchmark for peak hour for Casual Classic Bike users (688) during August between 6-7pm, which is also the overall peak hour across all stations.
